## Definition of Done

Phase is complete when ALL of the following are true:

### Implementation
- [ ] All stories implemented
- [ ] All code compiles/parses without errors

### Testing
- [ ] All tests written
- [ ] Test quality score: A, B, or C (not D or F)
- [ ] All tests passing

### Quality
- [ ] Ruff: No blocking linting issues
- [ ] ty: No type errors in changed code
- [ ] Complexity: No functions > 20 cognitive complexity

### Documentation
- [ ] Code comments where non-obvious
- [ ] API docs updated (if applicable)

### Verification
- [ ] All acceptance criteria verified by QA agent
- [ ] DoD agent confirms phase complete
