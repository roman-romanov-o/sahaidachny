# Complexity Analysis

Use `complexipy` to find overly complex functions.

## Commands

- `complexipy <path> --max-complexity <threshold>`

## Guidance

- Report functions exceeding the threshold.
- Recommend refactors that reduce nesting and branching.
- Focus on changes introduced in this iteration.
